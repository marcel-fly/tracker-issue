# tracker-issue

The application was created with create-react-app and uses typescript. The backend was created using
node.js and the database is mongodb. To transfer and store data on the frontend, redux was used, which is not necessary in such a small application, but may be useful in its future development.

# Possible improvements and future solutions

- adding optimistic updates
- improved redux typing
- url and password to database would be in ENV
- adding unit, integration and E2E tests
- improved design nad resposiveness
