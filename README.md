# tracker-issue

The app was created using create-react-app and uses typescript. The backend was created using node.js and the database is mongodb. Redux was used to transfer and store data on the frontend, which is not necessary for such a small app, but may be useful for future development.

# Possible improvements and future solutions

- add optimistic updates
- improve redux typing
- url and password store in ENV
- add unit, integration and E2E tests
- improve design and resposiveness
