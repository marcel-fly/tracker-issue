The app was created using create-react-app and used typescript. The backend was created using node.js and the database was mongodb. Redux was used to transfered and stored data on the frontend, which was not necessary for such a small app, but may be useful for future development.

# Possible improvements and future solutions

- add optimistic updates
- improve redux typing
- url and password store in ENV
- add unit, integration and E2E tests
- improve design and resposiveness
