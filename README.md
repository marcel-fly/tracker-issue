# tracker-issue

The application was created with create-react-app and uses typescript. The backend was created using
node.js and the database is mongodb. To transfer and store data on the frontend, redux was used, which is not necessary in such a small application, but may be useful in its future development.

# Possible improvements and future solutions

- add optimistic updates
- improve redux typing
- url and password store in ENV
- add unit, integration and E2E tests
- improve design and resposiveness
